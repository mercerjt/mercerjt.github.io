# Daniel's Wishlist
These are things that we've had our eye on and save for our own reference of "that's something that would add/complement something Daniel already has", so it makes sense to share with others that may ask us "what kind of presents does Daniel want?"

## Top Ideas:
1. [Lego 4-8 year old sets](https://www.lego.com/en-us/categories/age-6-plus-years)
2. Kids size 6 clothing for winter, or 7 for spring/summer
3. [Superspace Panels](https://www.getsuperspace.com/products/the-big-set)
4. KiwiCo sets like [Santa's Railroad Advent Calendar ($50)](https://www.kiwico.com/us/store/dp/santas-railroad-advent-calendar-project-kit/5558)
5. [Magna-Tiles](https://magnatiles.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopyJs7vEHNzl1oNMAvMFb7WrHUUAxXI0ahfDKe5kYUWRYnq1kwY)
6. [Contributions to his 529 (with code 53S-31U)](https://www.ugift529.com)

## LEGO Duplo & Ages 4

## Books
Daniel loves to read and loves to read to us. Currently, anything to do with construction vehicles, Paw Patrol, or Bluey are his favorites.

## Puzzles
Daniel is HUGE into puzzles at the moment. Keep them age-appropriate in terms of size though! (Under 200 pieces please!) He has really loved puzzles that connect with things he likes (e.g. Pokémon, Bluey, etc.)

## Clothes
We're currently buying for toddler size 6/7 stuff for Winter 2025/Spring 2026
