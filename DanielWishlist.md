# Daniel's Wishlist
These are things that we've had our eye on and save for our own reference of "that's something that would add/complement something Daniel already has", so it makes sense to share with others that may ask us "what kind of presents does Daniel want?"

## LEGO Duplo & Ages 4+
Daniel LOVES playing with his LEGO Duplo sets right now, and he's right on the border of playing with the 4+ yr old LEGOs. His favorites are his LEGO train sets and anything with vehicles (especially vehicles that have some kind of "push-and-go" inertia effect or motion). Here's some we know he doesn't own:
- [60452 Donut Truck ($20)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/donut-truck-60452)
- [60463 Fire Ladder Truck ($20)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/fire-ladder-truck-60463)
- [60411 Fire Rescue Helicopter ($10)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/fire-rescue-helicopter-60411)
- [60401 Construction Steamroller ($10)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/construction-steamroller-60401)
- [60404 Burger Truck ($20)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/burger-truck-60404)
- [60435 Tow Truck and Sports Car Repair ($20)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/tow-truck-and-sports-car-repair-60435)


## Books
Daniel loves to read and loves to read to us. Currently, anything to do with construction vehicles, Paw Patrol, or Bluey are his favorites.

## Puzzles
Daniel is HUGE into puzzles at the moment. Keep them age-appropriate in terms of size though! (Under 50 pieces please!)

## Clothes
