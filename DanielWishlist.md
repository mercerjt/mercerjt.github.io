# Daniel's Wishlist
These are things that we've had our eye on and save for our own reference of "that's something that would add/complement something Daniel already has", so it makes sense to share with others that may ask us "what kind of presents does Daniel want?"

## LEGO Duplo
Daniel LOVES playing with his LEGO Duplo sets right now. His favorites are his LEGO Duplo train sets and anything with vehicles (especially vehicles that have some kind of "push-and-go" inertia effect). Here's some we know he doesn't own:
- [10874 Steam Train](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/steam-train-10874)
- [10872 Train Bridge and Tracks](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/train-bridge-and-tracks-10872)

## Books
Daniel loves to read and loves to read to us. He does best with board books since he can turn the pages easier by himself and is willing to sit and read to himself or bring it over to us.

## Puzzles
Daniel is HUGE into puzzles at the moment. Keep them age-appropriate in terms of size though! (Under 50 pieces please!)

## Clothes
We're currently planning for toddler size 5/6 stuff for Fall/Winter 2024

## Other Things
Daniel has gotten BIG into puzzles. Currently he's doing puzzles that range from multipack 4-piece puzzles (think 5 puzzles each 4 pieces in a box) up to 40-piece puzzles. He does much better with ones that involve vehicles and/or animals.
Daniel also loves his BRIO wooden train tracks and sets to continue extending his alternate play area. He also loves little-kid-frienly arts & crafts sets and doing science experiments with his dad.
