# Daniel's Wishlist
These are things that we've had our eye on and save for our own reference of "that's something that would add/complement something Daniel already has", so it makes sense to share with others that may ask us "what kind of presents does Daniel want?"

## Top Ideas:
1. [Lego 4-8 year old sets](https://www.lego.com/en-us/categories/age-6-plus-years)
2. Kids size 6 clothing for winter, or 7 for spring/summer
3. KiwiCo sets like [Santa's Railroad Advent Calendar ($50)](https://www.kiwico.com/us/store/dp/santas-railroad-advent-calendar-project-kit/5558)
4. [Contributions to his 529 (with code 53S-31U)](https://www.ugift529.com/gifttpl/ugift/create/viewGiftCodeDetails.cs?ugiftcode=53S-31U)

## LEGO Ages 4-8 year old sets
Daniel LOVES playing with his LEGO sets right now, and he's getting into playing with the "real" 4+ yr old LEGOs. His favorite though are sets that are ["Build Together" compatible (click here)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/builder-app/build-together-sets?filters.i0.key=categories.id&filters.i0.values.i0=5762f826-7e6e-4f68-babb-eaf8692b4fa8&filters.i0.values.i1=96aff015-13f0-4d30-a4d1-d0a31d16f16c)! As far as themes, he liks his LEGO City sets and anything with vehicles. Here's some we know he doesn't own:

## Books
Daniel loves to read and loves to read to us. Currently, anything to do with construction vehicles, Paw Patrol, or Bluey are his favorites.

## Puzzles
Daniel phases in & out of puzzles at the moment. Keep them age-appropriate in terms of size though! (Under 200 pieces please!) He has really loved puzzles that connect with things he likes (e.g. Pokémon, Bluey, etc.)

## Clothes
We're currently buying for toddler size 6 & 7 for Spring/Summer 2026.
