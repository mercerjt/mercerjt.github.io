# Daniel's Wishlist
These are things that we've had our eye on and save for our own reference of "that's something that would add/complement something Daniel already has", so it makes sense to share with others that may ask us "what kind of presents does Daniel want?"

## LEGO Duplo
Daniel LOVES playing with his LEGO Duplo sets right now, and he's right on the border of playing with the 4+ yr old LEGOs. His favorites are his LEGO train sets and anything with vehicles (especially vehicles that have some kind of "push-and-go" inertia effect or motion). Here's some we know he doesn't own:
- [10987 Recycling Truck](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/recycling-truck-10987)
- [10959 Police Station & Helicopter](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/police-station-helicopter-10959)
- [10965 Bath Time Fun Floating Animal Train](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/bath-time-fun-floating-animal-train-10965)
- [10994 3in1 Family House](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/3in1-family-house-10994)
- [10874 Steam Train](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/steam-train-10874)
- [10882 Train Tracks](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/train-tracks-10882)

## Books
Daniel loves to read and loves to read to us. Currently, anything to do with construction vehicles, Paw Patrol, or Bluey are his favorites.

## Puzzles
Daniel is HUGE into puzzles at the moment. Keep them age-appropriate in terms of size though! (Under 50 pieces please!)

## Clothes
We're currently planning for toddler size 5/6 stuff for 2025
