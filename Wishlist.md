# Wishlist
I used to use my Amazon wishlist as my universal spot for all things. Unfortunately at some point in 2023, Amazon started blocking users from adding non-Amazon.com things to their wishlist, probably because it encouraged you to shop *not* on Amazon. As a result, I needed a new spot to host it!
Some of these items I've eyed getting for myself when the time is right, the sale is on, the winds in the east, mist coming in, etc. and others I think "That's nice and I kinda want it but wouldn't be willing to buy it right now".

## Board Games
This is my latest & greatest & most expensive hobby. Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle (a cooperative, deck-building game) got me really into this kind of hobby in 2021. Now, I'm huge into any kind of highly-rated board game, **especially co-operative games** since those are ones I can get Jane (and maybe you) to play too! Here's some I don't have that I've got my eye on:

## Video Games
Video games have been my go-to destresser/relaxation tool since I was introduced to Pokémon Red and the Game Boy Pocket in 1998. Today, I still keep up with a few specific series (including Pokémon, Assassin's Creed, the Legend of Zelda, and others), but I also generally enjoy two main genres:  online co-operative games and single player open-world RPG games. I definitely prefer to own a **digital** rather than physical copy of a game Here's some things in the video game & related accessories I've got my eye on:

## Books
I always appreciate any new books that you personally recommend or enjoy. Otherwise, I usually find myself reading fiction in the sci-fi or fantasy genres - and usually ones that are part of a series rather than one-offs. I try to make an effort to add new Hugo/Nebula award winner books to my "To Read" list as well. In the non-fiction space, I prefer reading current affairs and policy advocacy or solution-advocacy books (e.g. delving into a public policy problem, the data behind different parts of the problems or attempted solutions, and what solutions the author advocates for & why).
I usually prefer a Kindle or EPUB book version of the book, but I don't mind the occasional physical book if that's what's available. Here's some that I currently have on my backlog to get & read:
- [My Pokémon Baking Book](https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/707E12105/my-pokemon-baking-book/?subid=82593449)
- [Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Radicals-Pragmatic-Primer-Realistic-ebook/dp/B003T0G9GM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

## LEGO
I've been a lifelong LEGO builder, and I have no plans on stopping anytime soon (especially now that I've got Daniel into them!). I of course appreciate the larger, more complex sets. Otherwise, I generally collect/love to build sets from the Harry Potter, Star Wars, Architecture/world wonders, and LEGO City collections. I do have a policy that I *don't build any Harry Potter sets until I can build them with Daniel (as part of a tradition/idea from Jane*. Here's a few on my wishlist:
- [Harry Potter: Hogwarts Castle and Grounds (76419)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXQ6NRRN/?coliid=I3IGEE747O5LS4&colid=1557LK19HNV8Y&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)

## Other Ideas
### Gift Cards to Specific Brands I enjoy
- Bonobos
- Mack Weldon
- Amazon

### Food & Drink
- Any Coffee Beans (whole or ground, roasted, darker roasts preferred over blonde/light roasts. Not a fan of robusta beans and "herbal" tasting roasts)
- Wine (I prefer tannic reds, dry/oaky whites, and dry to extra-dry sparklings)
- Non-fruity ice cream
- Meal delivery services (used to really enjoy Blue Apron since I didn't have to plan what to shop/cook for the week)
