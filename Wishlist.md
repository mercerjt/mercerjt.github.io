# Wishlist
I used to use my Amazon wishlist as my universal spot for all things. Unfortunately at some point in 2023, Amazon started blocking users from adding non-Amazon.com things to their wishlist, probably because it encouraged you to shop *not* on Amazon. As a result, I needed a new spot to host it!

## Board Games
This is my latest & greatest & most expensive hobby. Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle (a cooperative, deck-building game) got me really into this kind of hobby in 2021. Now, I'm huge into any kind of highly-rated board game, **especially co-operative games** since those are ones I can get Jane (and maybe you) to play too! Here's some I don't have that I've got my eye on:

## Video Games
Video games have been my go-to destresser/relaxation tool since I was introduced to Pokémon Red and the Game Boy Pocket in 1998. Today, I still keep up with a few specific series (including Pokémon, Assassin's Creed, the Legend of Zelda, and others), but I also generally enjoy two main genres:  online co-operative games and single player open-world RPG games. I definitely prefer to own a **digital** rather than physical copy of a game Here's some things in the video game & related accessories I've got my eye on:
- Nintendo eShop gift cards in order to get:

## Books
I always appreciate any new books that you personally recommend or enjoy. Otherwise, I usually find myself reading fiction in the sci-fi or fantasy genres - and usually ones that are part of a series rather than one-offs. I try to make an effort to add new Hugo/Nebula award winner books to my "To Read" list as well. In the non-fiction space, I prefer reading current affairs and policy advocacy or solution-advocacy books (e.g. delving into a public policy problem, the data behind different parts of the problems or attempted solutions, and what solutions the author advocates for & why).
I usually prefer a Kindle or EPUB book version of the book, but I don't mind the occasional physical book if that's what's available. Here's some that I currently have on my backlog to get & read:
- [It's All Too Much by Peter Walsh](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000N2HCP6/?coliid=I2TIZT57VZ47Z7&colid=1557LK19HNV8Y&psc=0&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
- [A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C7BCB88/?coliid=I2QZ4HB0IIATHV&colid=1557LK19HNV8Y&psc=0&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
- [Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Radicals-Pragmatic-Primer-Realistic-ebook/dp/B003T0G9GM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

## LEGO
I've been a lifelong LEGO builder, and I have no plans on stopping anytime soon (especially now that I've got Daniel into them!). I of course appreciate the larger, more complex sets. Otherwise, I generally collect/love to build sets from the Harry Potter, Star Wars, Architecture/world wonders, and LEGO City collections. I do have a policy that I *don't build any Harry Potter sets until I can build them with Daniel (as part of a tradition/idea from Jane*. Here's a few on my wishlist:
- [Harry Potter: Hogwarts Castle and Grounds (76419)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXQ6NRRN/?coliid=I3IGEE747O5LS4&colid=1557LK19HNV8Y&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
